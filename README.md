## Introduction

The Todo app is a mobile application developed using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building beautiful native applications for iOS and Android. This app aims to help users manage their tasks and stay organized by providing a simple and intuitive interface for creating, editing, and completing todos.

The app utilizes HiveDB, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database for Flutter, to store and manage the todo data. HiveDB offers efficient data persistence and retrieval, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

## Features

The Todo app includes the following features:

1. Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
2. Task Listing: Users can view their tasks in a list format, organized by due dates.
3. Task Editing: Users can edit task details such as title, description, and due date.
4. Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as complete when they are finished.
5. Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
6. Data Persistence: The app uses HiveDB to store tasks locally, ensuring data is preserved even when the app is closed or restarted.

## Dependencies

The app relies on the following dependencies:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)
- [Hive Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter)
- [Path Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)

These dependencies will be automatically resolved when you follow the installation instructions mentioned below.

## Installation

To install and set up the Todo app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Flutter installed on your system. If not, please refer to the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for instructions.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.
4. Retrieve the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

5. Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer or set up a virtual device.
6. Run the app using the following command:

The tasks will be displayed in a list format, sorted by due dates. You can edit task details, mark tasks as complete, or delete tasks as needed. The todo data will be persisted using HiveDB, ensuring that your tasks are preserved even if the app is closed or restarted.

Feel free to customize the app's functionality by modifying the code according to your specific requirements.
